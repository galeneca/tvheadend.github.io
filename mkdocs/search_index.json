For more detailed\ninformation, please consult the rest of this guide - much of it is arranged in the same order as the tabs on the\nTvheadend interface so you know where to look.\n\n\nYou can also consult the in-application help text, which mirrors this guide to a very great extent.\n\n\n1. Ensure tuners are available for use\n\n\ntvheadend web interface: \nConfiguration -\n DVB Inputs -\n TV Adapters\n\n\nOn this tab, you\nll see a tree structure, with the Linux device list at the top level (e.g. \n/dev/dvb/adapter0\n)\n\n\nIndividual tuners are then the next level down (e.g. \nDiBcom 7000PC : DVB-T #0\n)\n\n\nClick on each tuner that you want tvheadend to use, and ensure \nEnabled\n is checked in the \nParameters\n list\n\n\nIf anything is obviously wrong at this point, you probably have a driver/firmware error which you\nll need to resolve before going any further.\n\n\n2. Set up relevant network(s)\n\n\ntvheadend web interface: \nConfiguration -\n DVB Inputs -\n Networks\n\n\nCreate a network of the appropriate type here. You can have multiple networks of the same type as necessary, e.g. to have two DVB-T networks defined, one with HD muxes, one without.\n\n\nThe creation process allows you to select from a series of pre-defined mux lists for common DVB sources. These are maintained outside of tvheadend, and are downloaded from linuxtv - but they do go out of date as broadcasters move services around and national authorities change entire pieces of spectrum. As such, you should try the pre-defined values, but you may need to add muxes manually.\n\n\n\n\nCritical Configuration Items\n\n\nCritical configuration items at this stage: \n<\n........>\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Associate the network with the respective tuner(s)\n\n\ntvheadend web interface: \nConfiguration -\n DVB Inputs -\n TV Adapters\n\n\nAssociate each of your tuners with the correct network through \nParameters -\n Basic Settings\n. \n\n\nThis can be as simple or as complex as necessary. You may simply have, for example, a single DVB-S2 network defined and then associate this with all DVB-S2 tuners. Or, you might have multiple networks defined - different satellites, different encoding. So, as further examples, you might define and then associate an HD DVB-T2 (e.g. H.264) network with HD tuners, while having a separate SD network associated with an independent SD (e.g. MPEG-2) tuner. \n\n\n\n\nCritical Configuration Items\n\n\nCritical configuration items at this stage: \n<\n........>\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, your tuners now know what networks to use: one network can appear on multiple tuners (many-to-one), and one tuner can have multiple networks.\n\n\n4. If necessary, manually add muxes to the network\n\n\ntvheadend web interface: \nConfiguration -\n DVB Inputs -\n Muxes\n\n\nIdeally, this is where you\nll see a list of the pre-populated muxes as created when you set up your initial network.

            "text": "This section gives a high-level overview of the steps needed to get Tvheadend up and running. For more detailed\ninformation, please consult the rest of this guide - much of it is arranged in the same order as the tabs on the\nTvheadend interface so you know where to look.  You can also consult the in-application help text, which mirrors this guide to a very great extent.  1. Ensure tuners are available for use  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  DVB Inputs -  TV Adapters  On this tab, you ll see a tree structure, with the Linux device list at the top level (e.g.  /dev/dvb/adapter0 )  Individual tuners are then the next level down (e.g.  DiBcom 7000PC : DVB-T #0 )  Click on each tuner that you want tvheadend to use, and ensure  Enabled  is checked in the  Parameters  list  If anything is obviously wrong at this point, you probably have a driver/firmware error which you ll need to resolve before going any further.  2. Set up relevant network(s)  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  DVB Inputs -  Networks  Create a network of the appropriate type here. You can have multiple networks of the same type as necessary, e.g. to have two DVB-T networks defined, one with HD muxes, one without.  The creation process allows you to select from a series of pre-defined mux lists for common DVB sources. These are maintained outside of tvheadend, and are downloaded from linuxtv - but they do go out of date as broadcasters move services around and national authorities change entire pieces of spectrum. As such, you should try the pre-defined values, but you may need to add muxes manually.   Critical Configuration Items  Critical configuration items at this stage:  < ........>   3. Associate the network with the respective tuner(s)  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  DVB Inputs -  TV Adapters  Associate each of your tuners with the correct network through  Parameters -  Basic Settings .   This can be as simple or as complex as necessary. You may simply have, for example, a single DVB-S2 network defined and then associate this with all DVB-S2 tuners. Or, you might have multiple networks defined - different satellites, different encoding. So, as further examples, you might define and then associate an HD DVB-T2 (e.g. H.264) network with HD tuners, while having a separate SD network associated with an independent SD (e.g. MPEG-2) tuner.    Critical Configuration Items  Critical configuration items at this stage:  < ........>   At this point, your tuners now know what networks to use: one network can appear on multiple tuners (many-to-one), and one tuner can have multiple networks.  4. If necessary, manually add muxes to the network  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  DVB Inputs -  Muxes  Ideally, this is where you ll see a list of the pre-populated muxes as created when you set up your initial network. However, should there be any issues, this is where you can manually add missing muxes. You only really need to worry about this if the pre-defined list didn t work (e.g. because of out-of-date data - damn those broadcasters, re-arranging their services without telling anyone ) or because automatic detection hasn t successfully found all the muxes over time.   If you do need to add something manually, you ll need to search the Internet for details of the appropriate transmitter and settings: satellites tend not to change much and are universal over a large area, but terrestrial muxes tend to be very localised and you ll need to know which specific transmitter you re listening to.   Good sources of transmitter/mux information include:    KingofSat  for all European satellite information    ukfree.tv  for UK DVB-T transmitters    Interactive EU DVB-T map  for primarily central and northern Europe     other major sources....?   You can also use  dvbscan  to force a scan and effectively ask your tuner what it can see.   Critical Configuration Items  Critical configuration items at this stage:  < ........>   5. Scan for services  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  DVB Inputs -  Services  This is where the services will appear as your tuners tune to the muxes based on the network you told them to look on. Again, remember what s happening: the tvheadend software is telling your tuner hardware (via the drivers) to sequentially tune to each mux it knows about, and then see what  programmes  it can see on that mux, each of which is identified by a series of unique identifiers that describe the audio stream(s), the video stream(s), the subtitle stream(s) and language(s), and so on.   To force a scan    6. Map services to channels  Once scanning for services is complete, you need to map the services to channels so your client can actually request them (i.e. so you can watch or record). You can do this in two places:  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  DVB Inputs -  Services  Press the  Map All  button  tvheadend web interface:  Configuration -  Channel/EPG -  Channels  Press the  Map Services  button   Any explanation on how a channel can map to multiple services  ......  Anything about using bouquets   7. Watch TV  That s it - you re done. You should now have a working basic tvheadend installation with channels mapped and ready for use!  As required, you may now wish to look into:   Setting up different EPGs (inc. localised character sets and timing offsets)  Setting up channel icons  Setting up recording profiles  Setting up streaming profiles (including transcoding)  Arranging your channels into groups (channel tags)  Setting up softcams for descrambling  Setting up access control rules for different client types/permission levels",

Typically\n  dvb-apps stores these in \n/usr/share/dvb/\n. Leave blank to use Tvheadend\ns\n  internal file set.\n\n\n\n\nTime Update\n\n\nTvheadend has a built-in capability to update the system time.\nHowever, you should bear in mind that DVB time is not highly\naccurate and is prone to both jitter and variation between different\ntransponders.\n\n\nWhere possible, it\u2019s probably still better to use an internet based\nNTP source to synchronise the system clock (i.e. through the\nunderlying operating system).\n\n\nUpdate time\n\n: Enable system time updates. This will only work if the user running\n  Tvheadend has rights to update the system clock (normally only root).\n\n\nEnable NTP driver\n\n: This will create an NTP driver (using shmem interface) that you can\n  feed into ntpd. This can be run without root privileges, but\n  generally the performance is not that great.\n\n\nUpdate tolerance (milliseconds)\n\n: Only update the system clock (doesn\u2019t affect NTP driver) if the\n  delta between the system clock and DVB time is greater than this.\n  This can help stop excessive oscillations on the system clock.\n\n\n\n\nPicons\n\n\nPicons (from \np\nersonal \nicons\n) are collections of similar icons that\ncan be automatically matched against your channels based on a number\nof technical parameters that will uniquely define a channel. The use\nof these parameters (e.g. mux, frequency, orbital position) removes\nthe ambiguity of using names - it\u2019s not case sensitive, it doesn\u2019t\ncare if there are spaces or not, and so on. You can generate picons\nyourself from existing images, or you can usually find sets pre-made\non the Internet if you search for them. They\u2019re a good way to get\nlarge numbers of icons matched quickly, and usually in a similar\nstyle (such as square, x * y pixels, with a consistent\nhighlight/reflection effect).\n\n\nPrefer picons over channel name\n\n: If both a picon and a channel-specific (e.g. channelname.jpg) icon\n  are defined, use the picon.\n\n\nChannel icon path\n\n: Path to an icon for this channel. This can be named however you\n  wish, as either a local (\nfile://\n) or remote (\nhttp://\n) image. The following\n  placeholders are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaceholder\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%C\n\n\nthe transliterated channel name in ASCII (safe characters, no spaces etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%c\n\n\nthe channel name (URL encoded ASCII)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: \nfile:///tmp/icons/%C.png\n or \nhttp://example.com/%c.png\n\n\nPicon path\n\n: Path to a directory (folder) containing your picon collection. This\n  can be named however you wish, as either a local (\nfile://\n) or remote\n  (\nhttp://\n) location - however, remember that it\u2019s pointing to a\n  directory as the picon names are automatically generated from the\n  service parameters frequency, orbital position, etc.).\n\n\nExample: \nfile:///home/hts/picons\n\n\n\n\nSAT\nIP Server\n\n\nSAT\nIP Server is something like DVB network tuner. Tvheadend can\nforward mpegts input streams including on-the-fly descramling to SAT>IP\nclients.\n\n\nOnly networks with the \u201cSAT\nIP Source\u201d field set are exported through\nthe SAT\nIP protocol. This field is matched through the \u201csrc\u201d parameter\nasked from the SAT\nIP client. Usually (and by default) this value is 1.\nFor satellite tuners, this value determines the satellite source (dish).\nBy specification position 1 = DiseqC AA, 2 = DiseqC AB, 3 = DiseqC BA, 4\n= DiseqC BB, but any numbers may be used - depends on the SAT>IP\nclient. Note that if you use a similar number for multiple networks, the\nfirst matched network containing the mux with requested parameters will\nwin (also for unknown mux).\n\n\nRTSP Port\n\n: Select RTSP port (TCP) for realtime commands from SAT>IP clients.\n  Usually (as defined in the specification) this port is 554. But as\n  extension, Tvheadend can use any TCP port value (which is default 9983\n  for non-root users). But the SAT\nIP client must allow to set this value\n  (Tvheadend client will obtain the RTSP port number automatically using\n  the XML description). If the RTSP port value is zero, the SAT>IP server\n  functionality is not enabled.\n\n\nSubscription Weight\n\n: Subscription weight value. Default value is 100 (standard streaming).\n  Note that the default value for DVR is 300 (normal priority).\n\n\nDescramble Services\n\n: The maximum limit of services descrambled per a mux. If zero, the\n  descrambling functionality is disabled.\n\n\nMuxes Handling\n\n: When SAT>IP client requests new mux configuration, Tvheadend can handle\n  it in three ways.

This tabs allow configuration of several general parameters that affect\nthe core Tvheadend functionality.  EDITOR S NOTE: THE TWO IMAGES BELOW SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A SINGLE ONE.     Menu Bar/Buttons  The following functions are available:     Button  Function      Save configuration     Clean image (icon) cache       Language Settings  Default Language(s) \n: Select the list of languages (in order of priority) to be used for\n  supplying EPG information to clients that don\u2019t provide their own\n  configuration.  The EPG information is NOT translated, this only applies to EPG\nproviders that give information (titles, descriptions, etc..) in\nmultiple languages.   DVB Scan Files Path  DVB scan files path \n: Select the path to use for DVB scan configuration files. Typically\n  dvb-apps stores these in  /usr/share/dvb/ . Leave blank to use Tvheadend s\n  internal file set.   Time Update  Tvheadend has a built-in capability to update the system time.\nHowever, you should bear in mind that DVB time is not highly\naccurate and is prone to both jitter and variation between different\ntransponders.  Where possible, it\u2019s probably still better to use an internet based\nNTP source to synchronise the system clock (i.e. through the\nunderlying operating system).  Update time \n: Enable system time updates. This will only work if the user running\n  Tvheadend has rights to update the system clock (normally only root).  Enable NTP driver \n: This will create an NTP driver (using shmem interface) that you can\n  feed into ntpd. This can be run without root privileges, but\n  generally the performance is not that great.  Update tolerance (milliseconds) \n: Only update the system clock (doesn\u2019t affect NTP driver) if the\n  delta between the system clock and DVB time is greater than this.\n  This can help stop excessive oscillations on the system clock.   Picons  Picons (from  p ersonal  icons ) are collections of similar icons that\ncan be automatically matched against your channels based on a number\nof technical parameters that will uniquely define a channel. The use\nof these parameters (e.g. mux, frequency, orbital position) removes\nthe ambiguity of using names - it\u2019s not case sensitive, it doesn\u2019t\ncare if there are spaces or not, and so on. You can generate picons\nyourself from existing images, or you can usually find sets pre-made\non the Internet if you search for them. They\u2019re a good way to get\nlarge numbers of icons matched quickly, and usually in a similar\nstyle (such as square, x * y pixels, with a consistent\nhighlight/reflection effect).  Prefer picons over channel name \n: If both a picon and a channel-specific (e.g. channelname.jpg) icon\n  are defined, use the picon.  Channel icon path \n: Path to an icon for this channel. This can be named however you\n  wish, as either a local ( file:// ) or remote ( http:// ) image. The following\n  placeholders are available:     Placeholder  Function      %C  the transliterated channel name in ASCII (safe characters, no spaces etc.)    %c  the channel name (URL encoded ASCII)     Example:  file:///tmp/icons/%C.png  or  http://example.com/%c.png  Picon path \n: Path to a directory (folder) containing your picon collection. This\n  can be named however you wish, as either a local ( file:// ) or remote\n  ( http:// ) location - however, remember that it\u2019s pointing to a\n  directory as the picon names are automatically generated from the\n  service parameters frequency, orbital position, etc.).  Example:  file:///home/hts/picons   SAT IP Server  SAT IP Server is something like DVB network tuner. Tvheadend can\nforward mpegts input streams including on-the-fly descramling to SAT>IP\nclients.  Only networks with the \u201cSAT IP Source\u201d field set are exported through\nthe SAT IP protocol. This field is matched through the \u201csrc\u201d parameter\nasked from the SAT IP client. Usually (and by default) this value is 1.\nFor satellite tuners, this value determines the satellite source (dish).\nBy specification position 1 = DiseqC AA, 2 = DiseqC AB, 3 = DiseqC BA, 4\n= DiseqC BB, but any numbers may be used - depends on the SAT>IP\nclient. Note that if you use a similar number for multiple networks, the\nfirst matched network containing the mux with requested parameters will\nwin (also for unknown mux).  RTSP Port \n: Select RTSP port (TCP) for realtime commands from SAT>IP clients.\n  Usually (as defined in the specification) this port is 554. But as\n  extension, Tvheadend can use any TCP port value (which is default 9983\n  for non-root users). But the SAT IP client must allow to set this value\n  (Tvheadend client will obtain the RTSP port number automatically using\n  the XML description). If the RTSP port value is zero, the SAT>IP server\n  functionality is not enabled.  Subscription Weight \n: Subscription weight value. Default value is 100 (standard streaming).\n  Note that the default value for DVR is 300 (normal priority).  Descramble Services \n: The maximum limit of services descrambled per a mux. If zero, the\n  descrambling functionality is disabled.  Muxes Handling \n: When SAT>IP client requests new mux configuration, Tvheadend can handle\n  it in three ways. The auto (0) configuration means that if the mux does\n  not exists, a temporary mux is created and removed when the client\n  closes the connection. The keep (1) configuration will remember all\n  successfuly scanned muxes. The reject (2) configuration will reject\n  unknown muxes.  Exported .... Tuners \n: Each option lists the tuners, by type, you wish to present over IP to other clients.   Image Caching  This will cache any channel icons or other images (such as EPG metadata)\nto be served from the local webserver. This can be useful for\nmulti-client systems and, generally, to reduce hits on upstream\nproviders.  Enabled \n: Select whether or not to enable caching. Note: even with this disabled\n  you can still specify local (file://) icons and these will be served by\n  the built-in webserver.  Re-fetch period (hours) \n: How frequently the upstream provider is checked for changes.  Re-try period (hours) \n: How frequently it will re-try fetching an image that has failed to be\n  fetched.  Ignore invalid SSL certificates \n: Ignore invalid/unverifiable (expired, self-certified, etc.) certificates",

Tune Before DiseqC \n: If set, one tune request (setup) is proceed before the DiseqC\n  sequence (voltage, tone settings). Some linux drivers require this\n  procedure.  Tune Repeats \n: If set, the tune requests are repeated using this number. Zero means\n  one tune requests, one two tune requests etc.  Skip Initial Bytes \n: If set, first bytes from the MPEG-TS stream are discarded. It may be\n  required for some drivers / hardware which does not flush completely\n  the MPEG-TS buffers after a frequency/parameters change.  Input Buffer (Bytes) \n: By default, linuxdvb input buffer is 18800 bytes long. The accepted\n  range is 18800-1880000 bytes.  Status Period \n: By default, linuxdvb status read period is 1000ms (one second). The\n  accepted range is 250ms to 8000ms. Note that for some hardware /\n  drivers (like USB), the status operations takes too much time and\n  CPU. In this case, increase the default value. For fast hardware,\n  this value might be descreased to make the decision of the re-tune\n  algorithm based on the signal status faster.  Force old status \n: Always use the old ioctls to read the linuxdvb status (signal\n  strength, SNR, error counters). Some drivers are not matured enough\n  to provide the correct values using the new v5 linuxdvb API.   LinuxDVB Satellite Config Rows  DiseqC repeats \n: Number of repeats for the DiseqC commands (default is zero - no\n  DiseqC repeats).  Full DiseqC \n: Always sent the whole DiseqC sequence including LNB setup (voltage,\n  tone). If this is not checked, only changed settings is set. It may\n  cause issues with some drivers. If the tuning is not reliable, try\n  to activate this option.  Turn off LNB when idle \n: Turn off LNB when it is not used. It may save some power.  Switch Then Rotor \n: If the DiseqC switch is before rotor (tuner - switch - rotor),\n  enable this.  Init Rotor Time (seconds) \n: Upon new start, tvheadend does not know the last rotor position.\n  This value defined the initial rotor movement. TVHeadend waits the\n  specified seconds when the first movement is requested.  Min Rotor Time (seconds) \n: The minimum delay after the rotor movement command is send.   SAT IP Specific Rows  Full Mux Rx mode supported \n: Enable if the SAT IP box supports the full mux rx mode ( pids=all )  Signal scale (240 or 100) \n: Some SAT IP boxes only report a 0-100 (percentage) signal strength.\n  If your signal strength reports as too low, try setting this to 100.  Maximum PIDs \n: Maximum supported PIDs in the filter of the SAT IP box.  Maximum length of PIDs \n: Maximum length in characters for the command setting PIDs to the\n  SAT IP box.  Addpids/delpids supported \n: Enable if the SAT IP box supports the  addpids / delpids  commands.  PIDs in setup \n: Enable if the SAT IP box requires  pids=0  parameter in the SETUP\n  RTSP command.  Double RTSP Shutdown \n: Enable if the SAT IP box might require to send twice the RTSP\n  SHUTDOWN command.  Force pilot for DVB-S2 \n: Enable if the SAT IP box requiest plts=on parameter in the SETUP\n  RTSP command for DVB-S2 muxes.  UDP RTP Port Number (2 ports) \n: Force the local UDP Port number here. The number should be even (RTP\n  port). The next odd number (+1) will be used as the RTCP port.  Satellite Positions \n: Select the number of satellite positions supported by the SAT IP\n  hardware and your coaxial cable wiring.  Master Tuner \n: Select the master tuner.   The signal from the standard universal LNB can be split using a\nsimple coaxial splitter (no multiswitch) to several outputs. In this\ncase, the position, the polarization and low-high band settings must\nbe equal.   If you set other tuner as master, then this tuner will act like a\nslave one and tvheadend will assure that this tuner will not use\nincompatible parameters (position, polarization, lo-hi).   Next tune delay in ms (0-2000) \n: The delay before tuning in milliseconds after tuner stop. If the\n  time after previous start and next start is greater than this\n  value - the delay is not applied.  Send full PLAY cmd \n: Send the full RTSP PLAY command after full RTSP SETUP command. Some\n  device firmwares require this to get MPEG-TS stream.  Override tuner count \n: Force tvheadend to see a specific number of tuners.   Some devices, notably AVM\u2019s FRITZ!Box Cable 6490, report wrong number of tuners\nand this setting allows you to override that. Any value below 1 or\nabove 32 is ignored. For now this setting requires a restart of\ntvheadend.   PIDs 21 in setup \n: Enable if the SAT IP box requires  pids=21  parameter in the SETUP\n  RTSP command.  Force teardown delay \n: Force the delay between RTSP TEARDOWN and RTSP SETUP command (value\n  from \u2018Next tune delay in ms\u2019 is used). Some devices are not able to\n  handle quick continuous tuning.  Tuner bind IP address \n: Force all network connections to this tuner to be made over the\n  specified IP address, similar to the setting for the SAT IP device\n  itself. Setting this overrides the device-specific setting.",

Subdirectory Options  Directory permissions \n: The permissions to be set on any sub-directories created for recordings.   This is useful if you need to manipulate the files after recording under\na different user ID, e.g. to chop out commercials.  Common examples:     Mode  Permissions      0755  rwxr-xr-x    0775  rwxrwxr-x (default)    0777  rwxrwxrwx     Note that the applicable umask applies, so  0777  with umask  0022  will\nproduce  0755  ( rwxr-xr-x ). See also  File permissions  in  Recording File\nOptions .   Make sub-directories per day \n: If checked, create a new directory per day in the recording system path.\n  Only days when anything is recorded will be created. The format of the\n  directory will be ISO standard  YYYY-MM-DD .  Make sub-directories per channel \n: If checked, create a directory per channel when storing events. If both\n  this and the \u2018directory per day\u2019 checkbox is enabled, the date-directory\n  will be parent to the per-channel directory.  Make sub-directories per title \n: If checked, create a directory per title when storing events. If the\n  day/channel directory checkboxes are also enabled, those directories\n  will be parents of this directory.   Filename Options  Include channel name in title \n: If checked, include the name of the channel in the event title. This\n  applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name\n  itself.  Include date in title \n: If checked, include the date for the recording in the event title. This\n  applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name\n  itself.  Include time in title \n: If checked, include the time for the recording in the event title. This\n  applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name\n  itself.  Include episode in title \n: If checked, include the season and episode in the title (if such info is\n  available).  Include subtitle in title \n: If checked, include the episode subtitle in the title (if such info is\n  available).  Put episode in filename before date and time \n: If checked, insert the episode number before the data and time rather\n  than after (assumes  Include date ,  Include time  and  Include episode \n  options are set).  Remove all unsafe characters from filename \n: If checked, all characters that could possibly cause problems for\n  filenaming will be replaced with underscore ( _ ).   Applies to characters:   not supported by Windows:  /   :   \\       |   *   ?   \"  control characters (ASCII code below 32)  control and national characters (ASCII code above 122)    Replace whitespace in title with \u2018-\u2019 \n: If checked, whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) will be replaced\n  with \u2018-\u2019.  Use Windows-compatible filenames \n: If checked, characters not supported in Windows filenames (e.g. for\n  an SMB/CIFS share) will be stripped out or converted.   Makes the following changes:   characters not supported by Windows ( /   :   \\       |   *  ?   \" ) will be replaced with underscore ( _ )  trailing spaces and dots will be removed    Changes to any of these settings must be confirmed by pressing the \u2018Save\nconfiguration\u2019 button before taking effect.",
