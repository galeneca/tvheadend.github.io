The tuner hardware\nis also responsible for communicating with your satellite dish via the LNB \nin the case of DVB-S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \ndriver\n is the piece of software that your operating system uses to\ntalk to the tuner. This can be built into the OS (e.g. \nsupported since kernel X\n) \nor might be a separate piece of software that you need install, and maybe \neven compile, separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirmware\n is a small piece of binary microcode that your system driver\nsends to the tuner upon initialisation. This is the cause of more problems\nthan you\nd imagine\n if you find yourself in trouble, this is the first\nthing to check along with kernel support for your hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication/Tvheadend Fundamentals\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Tvheadend software then sets up a series of configuration elements, and\nthe way in which these interact determines how a TV signal ends up in front\nof you. They all use what\ns known as a \nmany-to-many\n relationship, in that\none configuration element can be related to multiple elements of the next\ntype, and vice versa: one tuner has multiple networks, one network can\nexist on multiple tuners. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nnetwork\n is the software definition of your carrier network. Broadly,\nit lays out what sort of network it is (such as DVB-T or DVB-S2), how it \ngets scanned, where the DVB-S satellite is in orbit, and similar. Networks\nare used by tuners so the hardware knows where to look for a signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworks then have \nmuxes\n. These are the carrier frequencies that exist on\nthe old analogue channels that are used to transmit multiple digital signals\nrather than a single analogue one. These signals are multiplexed together,\nhence the name \nmux\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuxes then carry \nservices\n. These are the individual streams of data.\nThey can be TV or radio programmes, they can provide data services such as\ndigital teletext, or they can be used as part of the control code for \ncatch-up IPTV services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, services are mapped to \nchannels\n. These are what you\nand your client software think in terms of: \nI\nd like to watch BBC One\nnow, please\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy The Complexity?\n\n\nSimply, because 'BBC One' might exist in many different places... it \nmight have regional variations on multiple frequencies (so different services\non different muxes); it might exist on more than one source (perhaps on two\ndifferent satellites); and it might thus be accessible through more than one\npiece of hardware (two satellite tuners, or one satellite and one terrestrial\ntuner).\n\n\nWhen you select the channel you want to watch or record, Tvheadend can\nthen map a path through all those variables to ask a particular tuner to\ngo and get the signal for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following diagram explains the relationship between these components:",

Firmware  is a small piece of binary microcode that your system driver\nsends to the tuner upon initialisation. This is the cause of more problems\nthan you d imagine  if you find yourself in trouble, this is the first\nthing to check along with kernel support for your hardware.    Application/Tvheadend Fundamentals \uf0c1  The Tvheadend software then sets up a series of configuration elements, and\nthe way in which these interact determines how a TV signal ends up in front\nof you. They all use what s known as a  many-to-many  relationship, in that\none configuration element can be related to multiple elements of the next\ntype, and vice versa: one tuner has multiple networks, one network can\nexist on multiple tuners.     The  network  is the software definition of your carrier network. Broadly,\nit lays out what sort of network it is (such as DVB-T or DVB-S2), how it \ngets scanned, where the DVB-S satellite is in orbit, and similar. Networks\nare used by tuners so the hardware knows where to look for a signal.    Networks then have  muxes . These are the carrier frequencies that exist on\nthe old analogue channels that are used to transmit multiple digital signals\nrather than a single analogue one. These signals are multiplexed together,\nhence the name  mux .    Muxes then carry  services . These are the individual streams of data.\nThey can be TV or radio programmes, they can provide data services such as\ndigital teletext, or they can be used as part of the control code for \ncatch-up IPTV services.    And finally, services are mapped to  channels . These are what you\nand your client software think in terms of:  I d like to watch BBC One\nnow, please .     Why The Complexity?  Simply, because 'BBC One' might exist in many different places... it \nmight have regional variations on multiple frequencies (so different services\non different muxes); it might exist on more than one source (perhaps on two\ndifferent satellites); and it might thus be accessible through more than one\npiece of hardware (two satellite tuners, or one satellite and one terrestrial\ntuner).  When you select the channel you want to watch or record, Tvheadend can\nthen map a path through all those variables to ask a particular tuner to\ngo and get the signal for you.   The following diagram explains the relationship between these components:",

Page Structure \uf0c1  The interface is made up of nested tabs, so similar functions are grouped\ntogether (e.g. all configuration items at the top level, then all configuration\nitems for a particular topic are below that).  Each tab is then typically laid out with a menu bar across the top that\nprovides access to Add/Save/Edit-type functions, and a grid like a spreadsheet\nbelow that. The grid items are frequently editable.  Most configuration items - certainly the ones that are common to all types\nof item covered by that tab - are in this grid. However, some item-specific\nconfiguraiton items are then only available through the  Add  and  Edit \ndialog boxes. For example, the main network configuration tab grid covers\nparameters common to DVB-S, -T, -C and IPTV networks, but specific things\nsuch as FEC rolloff or mux URL are then only in the dialogs for networks\nthat need these values.

Add/Edit Dialog Example \uf0c1  A common set of fields is used for the  Add  or  Edit  functions, most\nof which can also be seen in the grid view:      Stream Profile Types \uf0c1  MPEG-TS Pass-through /build-in \n: Pass through of MPEG-TS packets.  Matroska (mkv) /build-in \n: Matroska/WebM muxer (built-in) to output in Matroska format.  HTSP Stream Profile \n: Stream Settings for HTSP.  MPEG-TS /av-lib \n: MPEG-TS stream muxer (libav) to output in MPEG-TS format\n  (only available with libav/ffmpeg).  Matroska /av-lib \n: Matroska/WebM muxer (libav) to output in Matroska format\n  (only available with libav/ffmpeg).  Transcode /av-lib \n: Transcode video/audio/subtitles with various encoders and output in various\n  formats (only available with libav/ffmpeg).  Common Settings \uf0c1  Enabled \n: Profile is enabled.  Default \n: Profile is the default profile.  Default Priority \n: The priority of the profile, if no specific priority was requested. This allows\n  to give certain users a higher priority by assigning a streaming profile with\n  a higher priority.  Force Priority \n: Don t allow the Default Priority to be overridden.  Timeout \n: Timeout for streaming to start.  Restart On Error \n: Restart streaming on error. This is useful for DVR, so a recording isn t aborted\n  if an error occurs.  Continue On Access Error \n: Don t abort streaming, when an encrypted stream can t be decrypted by a\n  CA client, that normally should be able to decrypt the stream.  Preferred Service Video Type  [ v4.2 ]\n: The selected video type should be preferred, when multiple services are\n  available for a channel.  MPEG-TS Pass-through Settings \uf0c1  Rewrite PMT/PAT/SDT/EIT \n: Rewrite PMT/PAT/SDT/EIT packets to only include information about the currently\n  streamed service.  Matroska Settings \uf0c1  WEBM \n: Use WebM format (WebM is a restricted subset of the Matroska format)  Transcode Settings \uf0c1  Container \n: Container to use for transcoded streams.  Resolution \n: Vertical resolution (height) of the output video stream. Horizontal resolution\n  is adjusted automatically to preserve aspect ratio. When set to 0, the input\n  resolution is used.  Channels \n: Channel layout for audio streams.  Language \n: Currently unused.  Video Codec \n: Video encoder codec.    Do not use \n: Don t output a video stream.    Copy codec type \n: Pass through video stream without transcoding.    mpeg2video/libvpx/libx264/ \n: Transcode video to the selected codec.    Video Bitrate \n: Video quality/bitrate of the transcoded video stream.    0: Automatic Setting (target quality) \n: The automatic setting is dependent on the used codec. The respective\n  values used are 5 for MPEG2 and 15 for H.264 and VP8, which are pretty high\n  and therefore might result in an even higher bitrate than the input video.    1-63: Target Quality \n: Use the given value to achieve average quality. A lower value results\n  in better quality. The resulting bitrate is dependent on the complexity\n  of the video stream.    63: Target Bitrate \n: Use the given value to achieve average bitrate. The resulting quality\n  is dependent on the complexity of the video stream.    Audio Codec \n: Codec for audio streams.    Do not use \n: Don t output an audio stream.    Copy codec type \n: Pass through audio streams without transcoding.    aac/mp2/libvorbis/ \n: Transcode audio to the selected codec. (Note: if  vorbis  and  libvorbis  are\n  available,  libvorbis  should be prefered when transcoding to Vorbis format)    Audio Bitrate \n: Audio bitrate of the transcoded audio streams.  Subtitles Codec \n: Codec for subtitles.    Do not use \n: Don t output subtitles.    Copy codec type \n: Pass through subtitles without transcoding.",

Leave as \u201csystem\u201d\n  unless you have a special case for one of the others.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you read or write data to the filesystems, the information\nis kept (cached) in memory for a while. This means that\nregularly-access files are available quickly without going back to\nthe disc; it also means that there\u2019s a disconnect when writing\nbetween the write request (from the application) and the actual\nwrite itself (to the disc/storage) as changes are buffered to be\nwritten in one go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnknown\n\n: A placeholder status, meaning that the configuration isn\u2019t properly\n  set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem\n\n: Change nothing and rely on standard (default) system caching to\n  behave as it normally would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not keep\n\n: Tell the system that you\u2019re not expecting to re-use the data soon,\n  so don\u2019t keep it in cache. The data will still be buffered for\n  writing. \nUseful e.g. in a RAM-limited system like a Pi (given that\n  you\u2019re unlikely to be watching while recording, so data can be\n  discarded now and read back from disc later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSync\n\n: Tell the system to write the data immediately. This doesn\u2019t affect\n  whether or not it\u2019s cached. \nUseful e.g. if you\u2019ve a particular\n  problem with data loss due to delayed write (such as if you get\n  frequent transient power problems).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSync + Do not keep\n\n: A combination of last two variants above - data is written\n  immediately and then discarded from cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDVR Log retention time (days)\n\n: Time that Tvheadend will keep information about the recording in its\n  internal database. Notice that the actual recorded file will not be\n  deleted when the log entry is deleted.\n\n\nExtra time before recordings (minutes)\n\n: Specify the number of minutes to record before the events scheduled\n  start time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.\n\n\nExtra time after recordings (minutes)\n\n: Specify the number of minutes to record after the events scheduled stop\n  time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.\n\n\nEpisode duplicate detection\n\n: If checked, broadcasts with matching title and matching non-zero episode\n  number are considered duplicates.\n\n\nEPG update window\n\n: Maximum difference between event start times when the EPG event is\n  changed. TVHeadend uses a fuzzy match logic (using title, start times,\n  duration, episode) to check when the event was changed.\n\n\nPost-processor command\n\n: Command to run after finishing a recording. The command will be run in\n  background and is executed even if a recording is aborted or an error\n  occurred.

            "text": "This tab is used to configure operation of the Digital Video Recorder.\nIt is not used for scheduling or administration of individual\nrecordings.    Menu Bar/Buttons \uf0c1  The following functions are available:     Button  Function      Save  Save any changes made to the DVR configuration    Undo  Undo any changes made to the DVR configuration since the last save.    Add  Add a new DVR configuration.    Delete  Delete an existing DVR configuration.    Help  Display this help page.      Configuration Options \uf0c1  DVR Behaviour \uf0c1  Media container \n: Select the container format used to store recordings.  Cache scheme \n: Select the cache scheme used to store recordings. Leave as \u201csystem\u201d\n  unless you have a special case for one of the others.   Whenever you read or write data to the filesystems, the information\nis kept (cached) in memory for a while. This means that\nregularly-access files are available quickly without going back to\nthe disc; it also means that there\u2019s a disconnect when writing\nbetween the write request (from the application) and the actual\nwrite itself (to the disc/storage) as changes are buffered to be\nwritten in one go.    Unknown \n: A placeholder status, meaning that the configuration isn\u2019t properly\n  set.    System \n: Change nothing and rely on standard (default) system caching to\n  behave as it normally would.    Do not keep \n: Tell the system that you\u2019re not expecting to re-use the data soon,\n  so don\u2019t keep it in cache. The data will still be buffered for\n  writing.  Useful e.g. in a RAM-limited system like a Pi (given that\n  you\u2019re unlikely to be watching while recording, so data can be\n  discarded now and read back from disc later).    Sync \n: Tell the system to write the data immediately. This doesn\u2019t affect\n  whether or not it\u2019s cached.  Useful e.g. if you\u2019ve a particular\n  problem with data loss due to delayed write (such as if you get\n  frequent transient power problems).    Sync + Do not keep \n: A combination of last two variants above - data is written\n  immediately and then discarded from cache.     DVR Log retention time (days) \n: Time that Tvheadend will keep information about the recording in its\n  internal database. Notice that the actual recorded file will not be\n  deleted when the log entry is deleted.  Extra time before recordings (minutes) \n: Specify the number of minutes to record before the events scheduled\n  start time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.  Extra time after recordings (minutes) \n: Specify the number of minutes to record after the events scheduled stop\n  time. Used to cope with small scheduling errors.  Episode duplicate detection \n: If checked, broadcasts with matching title and matching non-zero episode\n  number are considered duplicates.  EPG update window \n: Maximum difference between event start times when the EPG event is\n  changed. TVHeadend uses a fuzzy match logic (using title, start times,\n  duration, episode) to check when the event was changed.  Post-processor command \n: Command to run after finishing a recording. The command will be run in\n  background and is executed even if a recording is aborted or an error\n  occurred. Use the %e error formatting string to check for errors, the\n  error string is \u201cOK\u201d if recording finished successfully.  Supported format strings:     Format  Description  Example value      %f  Full path to recording  /home/user/Videos/News.mkv    %b  Basename of recording  News.mkv    %c  Channel name  BBC world    %O  Owner of this recording  user    %C  Who created this recording  user    %t  Program title  News    %s  Program subtitle  Afternoon    %p  Program episode  S02.E07    %d  Program description  News and stories\u2026    %e  Error message  Aborted by user    %S  Start time stamp of recording, UNIX epoch  1224421200    %E  Stop time stamp of recording, UNIX epoch  1224426600      Example usage  To use special characters (e.g. spaces), either put the string in quotes or escape the individual characters.  /path/to/ffmpeg -i \"%f\" -vcodec libx264 -acodec copy \"/path/with white space/%b\"    Recording File Options \uf0c1  Recording system path \n: Path to where Tvheadend will write recorded events. If components of the\n  path does not exist, Tvheadend will try to create them.  File permissions \n: The permissions to be set on the resultant recording files.   This is useful if you need to manipulate the files after recording under a\ndifferent user ID, e.g. to chop out commercials.  Common examples:     Mode  Permissions      0644  rw-r\u2013r\u2013    0664  rw-rw-r\u2013 (default)    0666  rw-rw-rw-     Note that the applicable umask applies, so  0666  with umask  0022  will\nproduce  0644  ( rw-r\u2013r\u2013 ). See also  Directory permissions  in Subdirectory Options .   Filename charset \n: Character set for the created filename. Tvheadend will try to\n  approximate characters to similarly looking ones.  Tag files with metadata \n: If checked, media containers that support metadata will be tagged with\n  the metadata associated with the event being recorded.  Skip commercials \n: If checked, commercials will be dropped from the recordings. At the\n  moment, commercial detection only works for the swedish channel TV4.   Full Pathname Specification \uf0c1  Format String \n: The string allow to manually specify the full path generation using\n  the predefined modifiers for strftime (see  man strftime , except\n   %n  and  %t ) and Tvheadend specific. Note that you may modify some of\n  this format string setting using the GUI fields below.     Format  Description  Example      $t$n.$x  Default format (title, unique number, extension)  Tennis - Wimbledon-1.mkv    $s  Event subtitle name  Sport    $t  Event title name  Tennis - Wimbledon    $e  Event episode name  S02-E06    $c  Channel name  SkySport    $n  Unique number added when the file already exists  -1    $x  Filename extension (from the active stream muxer  mkv    %F  ISO 8601 date format  2011-03-19    %R  The time in 24-hour notation  14:12     The format strings  $t , $s , %e , $c  also have delimiter variants such as  $ t  (space after the dollar character),  $-t ,  $_t , $.t ,  $,t ,  $;t . In these cases, the delimiter is applied \nonly when the substituted string is not empty.   Subdirectory Options \uf0c1  Directory permissions \n: The permissions to be set on any sub-directories created for recordings.   This is useful if you need to manipulate the files after recording under\na different user ID, e.g. to chop out commercials.  Common examples:     Mode  Permissions      0755  rwxr-xr-x    0775  rwxrwxr-x (default)    0777  rwxrwxrwx     Note that the applicable umask applies, so  0777  with umask  0022  will\nproduce  0755  ( rwxr-xr-x ). See also  File permissions  in  Recording File\nOptions .   Make sub-directories per day \n: If checked, create a new directory per day in the recording system path.\n  Only days when anything is recorded will be created. The format of the\n  directory will be ISO standard  YYYY-MM-DD .  Make sub-directories per channel \n: If checked, create a directory per channel when storing events. If both\n  this and the \u2018directory per day\u2019 checkbox is enabled, the date-directory\n  will be parent to the per-channel directory.  Make sub-directories per title \n: If checked, create a directory per title when storing events. If the\n  day/channel directory checkboxes are also enabled, those directories\n  will be parents of this directory.   Filename Options \uf0c1  Include channel name in title \n: If checked, include the name of the channel in the event title. This\n  applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name\n  itself.  Include date in title \n: If checked, include the date for the recording in the event title. This\n  applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name\n  itself.  Include time in title \n: If checked, include the time for the recording in the event title. This\n  applies to both the titled stored in the file and to the file name\n  itself.  Include episode in title \n: If checked, include the season and episode in the title (if such info is\n  available).  Include subtitle in title \n: If checked, include the episode subtitle in the title (if such info is\n  available).  Put episode in filename before date and time \n: If checked, insert the episode number before the data and time rather\n  than after (assumes  Include date ,  Include time  and  Include episode \n  options are set).  Remove all unsafe characters from filename \n: If checked, all characters that could possibly cause problems for\n  filenaming will be replaced with underscore ( _ ).   Applies to characters:   not supported by Windows:  /   :   \\       |   *   ?   \"  control characters (ASCII code below 32)  control and national characters (ASCII code above 122)    Replace whitespace in title with \u2018-\u2019 \n: If checked, whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) will be replaced\n  with \u2018-\u2019.  Use Windows-compatible filenames \n: If checked, characters not supported in Windows filenames (e.g. for\n  an SMB/CIFS share) will be stripped out or converted.   Makes the following changes:   characters not supported by Windows ( /   :   \\       |   *  ?   \" ) will be replaced with underscore ( _ )  trailing spaces and dots will be removed    Changes to any of these settings must be confirmed by pressing the \u2018Save\nconfiguration\u2019 button before taking effect.",

You can download it from the webui at \nhttp://IP:Port/playlist\n, e.g. \nhttp://192.168.0.2:9981/playlist\n.\n\n\nQ: Why am I getting a playlist when trying to view/stream a channel?\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBy default Tvheadend\ns \nPlay\n links are playlists, although not all players accept them (e.g. Media Player Classic Home Cinema). You can bypass this by removing the \n/play/\n path from the url.\n\n\nQ: Tvheadend has scanned for services but some rows in the Service Name column are blank, is that normal?\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYes, not all services are given a name by providers. These services are usually hidden for a reason and are often used for things such as encrypted guide data for set-top boxes, interactive services, and so on.\n\n\nIf you\nre not seeing any service names at all this may indicate an issue with your hardware and/or configuration.\n\n\nQ: I get a blank page when trying to view the web interface!\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis usually happens when Tvheadend is installed incorrectly. As a start, make sure that the web interface path \n/usr/share/tvheadend/src/webui/static/\n exists and isn\nt empty. \n\n\nNote: The above path only applies to Debian/Ubuntu systems others may differ.\n\n\nQ: Why can\nt I see my tuners in Tvheadend\ns interface?\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is normally because they\nre not installed properly. Check syslog/dmesg (e.g. \ndmesg | grep dvb\n) and see that you have startup \nmessages that indicate whether or not the tuenrs have initialized properly. Similarly, check \n/dev/dvb\n to \nsee if the block device files (i.e. the files used to communicate with the tuner) have been created correctly.\n\n\nThe other major cause of this issue is when you\nre running Tvheadend as a user who doesn\nt have sufficient\naccess to the tuners, such as not being a member of the \nvideo\n group.",

For that reason, use HTML instead, and it ll survive conversion:   NOTE: This is a note \n     This is an admonition - a note, warning, or other attention-grabber.  \n     Note that you can't include markdown in HTML, so need to write it by hand \n     HTML formatting includes  italic ,  bold , \n     bold italic , strikethrough , \n     underline , and  keyboard \n\n     You can include \n\n     \n       Unordered lists (aka. bullets) \n       Bullets \n     \n\n     and \n\n     \n       Lists \n       Lists \n       Lists \n     \n\n     You can include tables, although you don't get all the formatting\n    unless you hack the CSS: \n\n     \n     \n         \n         First \n         Second \n         Third \n       \n     \n     \n       \n         Cell 1 \n         Cell 2 \n         Cell 3 \n       \n       \n         Cell 1 \n         Cell 2 \n         Cell 3 \n       \n     \n     \n\n     You can include  code \n\n     Code blocks kind-of-work but needs more styling - they're not pretty: \n\n     echo Hello $1\\!\n    echo\n    echo Goodbye   Code for all of the above:  div class= admonition note  p class= admonition-title NOTE: This is a note /p \n     p This is an admonition - a note, warning, or other attention-grabber. /p  \n     p Note that you can't include markdown in HTML, so need to write it by hand /p \n     p HTML formatting includes  em italic /em ,  strong bold /strong , \n     em strong bold italic /strong /em , del strikethrough /del , \n     u underline /u , and  kbd keyboard /kbd /p \n\n     p You can include /p \n\n     ul \n       li Unordered lists (aka. bullets) /li \n       li Bullets /li \n     /ul \n\n     p and /p \n\n     ol \n       li Lists /li \n       li Lists /li \n       li Lists /li \n     /ol \n\n     p You can include tables, although you don't get all the formatting\n    unless you hack the CSS: /p \n\n     table \n     thead \n         tr class= header \n         th align= left First /th \n         th align= left Second /th \n         th align= left Third /th \n       /tr \n     /thead \n     tbody \n       tr class= odd \n         td align= left Cell 1 /td \n         td align= left Cell 2 /td \n         td align= left Cell 3 /td \n       /tr \n       tr class= even \n         td align= left Cell 1 /td \n         td align= left Cell 2 /td \n         td align= left Cell 3 /td \n       /tr \n     /tbody \n     /table \n\n     p You can include  code code /code /p \n\n     p Code blocks kind-of-work but needs more styling - they're not pretty: /p \n\n     p code echo Hello $1\\!\n    echo\n    echo Goodbye /code /p  /div   Other admonition types are defined and available:  div class=\"admonition tip\"  p class=\"admonition-title\" TIP: Sample title /p  p Sample text /p  /div    TIP: Sample title  Sample text   div class=\"admonition warning\"  p class=\"admonition-title\" WARNING: Sample title /p  p Sample text /p  /div    WARNING: Sample title  Sample text   div class=\"admonition danger\"  p class=\"admonition-title\" DANGER: Sample title /p  p Sample text /p  /div    DANGER: Sample title  Sample text   Other HTML \uf0c1  As a general rule, you can include any HTML in markdown if you need it. \nIt does defeat the easy-to-write/easy-to-read object, though, so use only \nas necessary.",
